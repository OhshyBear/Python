# Python
This is where I am storing some Python code it was the first coding course I took in college and it was on a different computer than the one I had when I uploaded this so the following files are just projects I have done on the new computer to try to stay somewhat refreshed on the language. However, it will suffice to showcase some experience and that I can learn and understand the language.<br>
GardenDream.py – Resizes an image to a 400px thumbnail. <br>
JPGtoPNG_Converter.py – Checks for an output folder, creates one if needed, and converts images from JPG to PNG. <br>
images.py – Uses Pillow (PIL) to manipulate Pokémon images with filters, transformations, and resizing. <br>
main.py – A random number generator guessing game. <br>

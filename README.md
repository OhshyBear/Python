# Python
This is where I am storing some Python code it was the first coding course I took in college so its not at the most presentable level. However, it will suffice to showcase some experience and that I can learn and understand the language.<br>
Garden Dream is a program to resize an image to a 400px thumbnail.<br>
main.py is a random number generator guessing game.<br>
images.py uses the Pillow (PIL) library to manipulate images of Pok√©mon in various ways, applying filters, transformations, and resizing. <br>
